# Linked List Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solved linked list problems! This collection is based on exercises and puzzles from the following books:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy in Java** by Narasimha Karumanchi
- **Data Structures and Algorithmic Puzzles** by Narasimha Karumanchi

In this repository, you'll find solutions to a variety of linked list problems that cover fundamental and advanced concepts in data structures and algorithms. Each solution is implemented in Java and is designed to demonstrate both correctness and efficiency.

## Problem List

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the linked list problems that have been addressed:

1. **Problem-1**  Implement Stack using Linked List
2. **Problem-2**  Find nth node from the end of a Linked List.
3. **Problem-3**  Can we improve the complexity of Problem-2?
4. **Problem-4**  Can we use the Problem-3 approach for solving Problem-2 without creating the hash table?
5. **Problem-5**  Can we solve Problem-2 in one scan?
6. **Problem-6**  Can we solve Problem-5 with recursion?
7. **Problem-7**  Check whether the given linked list is either NULL-terminated or ends in a cycle (cyclic)
8. **Problem-8**  Can we use the hashing technique for solving Problem-7?
9. **Problem-10**  Can we solve the Problem-6 in O(n)?
10. and so on......
